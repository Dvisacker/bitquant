This is an equation called Ito's Lemma which is very commonly used in
mathematical finance.  
<p>
The first line says that you have a new function over time that has a
"non-wiggly" part added to a "wiggly" part.  Typically this is a stock
price which has a "non-wiggly" part and a "wiggly" part.
<p>
So the first line just defines the process.
<p>
Now I want to calculate a new function that is based on the random
process.  A trivial example is if I have the equation for one share of
stock and I want to calculate the behavior of two shares of stock.  A
less trivial example would be if I have a basket of stocks that is
changing over time, or if I have something like a stock option which
whose value isn't a trivial function of that stock.
<p>
The second line says that if I perform a function on a random process
(i.e a function with a "non-wiggly" and a "wiggly" part) that I get a
new random process with a different "non-wiggly" and a "wiggly" part.
