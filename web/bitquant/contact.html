<h2>Networking with Joseph Wang</h2>
I am very active in the HK startup community, and you can run into us
at tech events posted on the HK Startup calendar.  You can ask me a
question on <a href="http://www.quora.com">Quora</a> and I can also
been found for one to one mentoring at
the <a href="http://hongkong.tie.org/tie-office-hours/">TiE Office
Hours</a> and at the pitch sessions for
the <a href="http://www.hkban.org/">HK Business Angels Network</a>.

<h2>Employment and internship requests</h2>
Bitquant has two employees, Joseph Wang and Su-Chen Liao.  It's my
firm condition that we will never have more than five employees.  As a
laboratory just having too many people creates a large, bloated
bureaucracy, and big bureaucracies just can't move fast enough to do
real research.
<p>
We do not hire employees, but rather we help people start their own
companies.  Also, we do contract with design firms, legal firms, and
various other vendors, and we meet people through the grape vine here
in Hong Kong.

<h2>Requests for funding</h2>
I spend a lot of time helping small companies in Hong Kong get
funding, and I also put some of my own money into small companies in
Hong Kong.  I do not do equity investments, but rather typically do
project based investments of about USD 10K.  The typical loan would be
for a widget manufacturer to pay for a Chinese factory to produce the
product, and would be about a 10% overhead for a loan that lasts for
about three months.  This gives you an effective annual interest rate
of about 40%, and if you can get money from someone other than me, you
should.  On the other hand, banks won't lend for these projects, and
while you could get the money from friends and family, the fact that
I'm charging you an high interest rate means that you don't owe me any
favors.
<p>
I also provide product and trade financing.  Typically the way that
this works is that the wholesaler wants a product from a Chinese
factory.  I get paid in the form of bitcoin, and add a markup of 25%
and a loan of 10% payable in three months.  One reason to go through
me is that I can guarantee quality of the goods.
