<h2>Your neighborhood financial technology research lab</h2>
<p>Bitquant Research Laboratories is mom and pop Hong Kong-based
  financial technology research laboratory developing technologies for
  local angel investing, trading between Africa and China, and for
  trading options and futures for Hong Kong equities and digital
  currencies.  All of our software is open source and available
  through our <a href="https://github.com/joequant/bitquant">github
  repository</a>.
<p>We have two employees, and we will never have more than five
  employees.  Having too many people in the company just creates a
  big, bloated bureaucracy, and big bureaucracies will kill any sort
  of innovation and creativity.  Rather, our goal is to create a
  network of tiny companies, most of them small and agile, which an
  pool resources and capital.

<h2>Projects</h2> 
Hong Kong angel investing - We are active angel investors in local
Hong Kong companies and have developed financial products and
methodologies to deal with the financing needs of local Hong Kong
companies using smart contracts.  Bitquant is pleased to have written
the first smart contract ever to be used for a real business
transaction.
<p>
African trade finance - We also are active in trading goods between
Africa and China, and we have developed innovative financing
structures to promote this trade.
<p>
Hong Kong/Digital Currency derivatives trading - We are active traders
in both the HK equity deriviatives markets and in digital currency
derivatives, and have written open source software to support this
trading.  Our goal is to provide small traders in Hong Kong the
quantitative tools for risk management and trade support previously
available only to large institutions.
