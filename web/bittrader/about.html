<h4>Bittrader Analytics System</h4>
Welcome to the garage.  Everything here is massively
under-construction.<p>
The Bittrader analytics system is an alert and analytics system designed
for individual traders and small proprietary shops.  It
consists of a web based system which can be uploaded to a cloud
server, and is powered by
the <a href="http://www.opengamma.com/">OpenGamma</a> risks analytics
engine, and <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> statistical
project.  Bitquant is developing this software to support its
proprietary trading of bitcoin and bitcoin derivatives.
<p>
The system completely open source and is distributed as
a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitquant/">disk image</a>
on sourceforge which can be run via VirtualBox or uploaded to a cloud
server.  The <a href="https://github.com/joequant/bitquant">source
code</a> is BSD-licensed and completely available at Github.  Check
out our <a href="https://github.com/joequant/bitquant/wiki">Wiki</a>
<p>
To check out our progress see
the <a href="http://bitquant.wordpress.com/">Bitquant blog</a>
<p>
Our target date for alpha for an MVP (minimally viable product) is
August 2014.
