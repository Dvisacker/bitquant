Using new technology for innovative financial products
------------------------------------------------------

Current technology requires that the project or funder invest several
tens of millions of dollars to create an investment.  To set up a fund
your costs are USD 100k/year, assuming 1-5% fund management, you need
AUM of 2 million to breakeven.

Need to reduce backend processing costs to zero, so funds go into deal
making and due dilligence

Projects that are not funded
----------------------------
1) Seed stage companies - Convertible bonds
2) Factoring and cash flow companies - gadget manufacturers in south
China
3) Geographically diverse areas - Southeast Asia, Africa, Russia

People who want to invest and can't
-----------------------------------
1) Mass affluent - People that want to invest USD 10k-50k in a project
2) People in various parts of the world - Southeast Asia, Africa, and
Russia

Use ICO technology to reduce backend costs
------------------------------------------

What to do:

Create exchange for professional investors
------------------------------------------

Use bitcoin exchange infrastructure.  Find an exchange which is
already profitable trading bitcoin and add the ability to trade shares
of hedge funds and innovative products.

Exchange will charge USD 5k for listing.  Regulatory/AML/KYC is done
by the issuer.  Exchange will display trades for products, but will
only authorize an account for trading if approved by issuer.  Issuer
can sell new shares on exchange.  Also transfers to and from exchange
is done by exchange communicating with issuer.

Since exchange is already profitable trading bitcoin, cost for adding
new trading pair is small.

Trading bitcoin will allow company to accept investors from all over
the world.  Opening accounts for companies authorized by issuer moves
AML/KYC/regulation to issuer.  Also allows for algo trading between
non-traditional products.  Also the exchange can be a marketing
channel, as providing information and limiting trading will prevent
the marketing from being seen as an offerring.

What is different from existing exchanges:

1) all efforts at existing exchanges have been product centered.  This
is a problem because the exchange can't make money if the product
isn't successful and the exchange cannot bootstrap listing of new
products.  In this system, the exchange is already making money
trading bitcoin. they can amortize costs among many different
products

2) AML/KYC/regulation is done by the issuer.  Also the issuer pays for
costs.

Create HKD/CNH coin
-------------------

Coin will be HKD/CNH token which is linked to an bank account.  Allows
user to store value, and buy and sell items

Create standardized tradable products
-------------------------------------

Set up convertible notes that are standarized for trading.

Create coin-based registration
------------------------------

Set up coins so that possession of the coin gives you the ability to
register ownership, and allows issuer to burn coins.  Coins then
become tokens that allow for registration rather than bearer shares.

Create legal box to allow coin owners to hold assets
----------------------------------------------------

Create badges for AML/KYC/regulation
------------------------------------
