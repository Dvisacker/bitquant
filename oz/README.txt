OZ scripts for creating bitstation images

Troubleshooting

* Make sure you have turned off your local firewall or else the
  installing image will not be able to see the remote servers.

* There seems to be problems directly creating a VDI file with the
  install kit for Mageia 4.  I've ended up with corrupted disk images.
  Things work when generating qcow2 files and then converting them to
  VDI.
