This working paper presents a simple model for the macroeconomic
behavior of bitcoin based on the economic equation of exchange.
According to this model, the value of bitcoin is determined largely by
the willingness of bitcoin holders to hoard bitcoin and not by its
transactional use.  This model therefore predicts that increased use
of bitcoin will not cause its value to rise, but that the value of
bitcoin will be almost solely determined by the willingness of bitcoin
holders to pull bitcoin out of circulation.  This model further
suggests that bitcoin will not fall victim to a liquidity as suggested
by some economists.

\section{Introduction} 

In this working paper, we present a model for the valuation of bitcoin
based on simple macroeconomic arguments.  We caution that our model is
intended primarily to stimulate discussion and that the truth of this
model or any economic model will be determined by empirical
observation of the bitcoin market.

\section{Macroeconomics of Bitcoin}

We begin our money with the equation of exchange where
\begin{equation}
M \dot V = P \dot Q
\end{equation}
where
$$
M \mbox{is the nominal amount of money}\\
V \mbox{is the velocity of money}\\
P \mbox{is the price level}\\
Q \mbox{is the index of real expenditures}\\
$$.

We now modify the equation in order to take into account the unique
aspects of bitcoin.  First we express all of our quantities in units
of fiat currency.  By expressing all of our quantities in terms of
fiat currency, we can set the $P$ to $1$.

We next expand the quantity $M$ in terms of the number of bitcoin in
circulation $n_b$ and the price of a single bitcoin $p_b$.  The number
of bitcoin in circulation is externally fixed, whereas the price of a
single bitcoin is the quantity which we are interested in.
Substituting $M=n_b p_b$ we and rearranging we get.

\begin{equation}
p_b = \frac{Q}{n_b V}
\end{equation}

We note that $n_b$ is an externally determined variable.  The key
variables which determine the price of bitcoin is the interaction
between the level of bitcoin usage and the velocity of bitcoin.

At this point we have made no assumptions concerning the dynamics of
bitcoin.  We shall now add some dynamical assumptions concerning the
relationship between the number of bitcoin expended $Q$ and the
velocity of an individual bitcoin $V$.

We decompose the velocity of bitcoin into a fraction that is saved
$f_s$ and a fraction that is involved with transactions $f_t$.  We
then claim that bitcoin which is saved has a zero velocity whereas
bitcoins which are spent in transactions have a velocity which is a
linear function of $Q$.  Therefore

\begin{equation}
V = f_t\alpha_t Q
\end{equation}.

Substituting back into the original equation we see that
\begin{equation}
p_b = \frac{1}{f_t \alpha_t}
\end{equation}.

We claim that $\alpha_t$ will remain roughly constant over time.  That
leaves only one term which is the $f_t$ the fraction of bitcoin which
is transacted.

\section{Implications of our model}
Our model makes very strong claims concerning the price of bitcoins.
In particular, it states that the price of bitcoin is determined
almost solely by the willingness of bitcoin users to transact a
particular bitcoin as opposed to saving that bitcoin.  If a user uses
bitcoin for transaction purposes then this has no impact on the value
of bitcoin, while the value of bitcoin rises a given bitcoin is more
likely to be saved rather than transacted.

This model seems to agree with the changes in bitcoin pricing in 2013.
The two events that caused bitcoin prices to increase were the Cyprus
banking crisis in April 2013 and the rise of mainland Chinese bitcoin
exchanges in October 2013.  Both these events increased the likelihood
that a given bitcoin would be saved rather than transacted which
increased the price of bitcoin.  We note that the main drivers for
bitcoin prices have been news reports concerning the convertibility of
bitcoin, and that news reports concerning the increasing usage of
bitcoin has made very little impact on its price.

We also note that bitcoin has is prone to sudden changes in price but
that the price of bitcoin after a sudden shock has returned to stable
levels.  Although shocks can cause a sudden change in the price of
bitcoin, to the extent that it does not cause a change in how likely a
bitcoin is saved or transacted, it will not cause a change in the
price level of bitcoin.

Our model also makes predictions concerning the future price of
bitcoin.  If our model is correct, then we should expect that
increased usage of bitcoin should manifest itself in larger volumes
rather than increased prices.  Prices in bitcoin would only be
effected by events which increase or decrease the likelihood that a
given bitcoin would be saved rather than transacted.

Some economists, notably Paul Krugman, are pessimistic about the
viability of bitcoin as a medium of exchange, because they believe
that bitcoin will fall into a liquidity trap caused by the fixed
supply of bitcoin (Krugman, 2013ï¼‰.  They claim that as the price of
bitcoin rises, the amount of bitcoin in circulation will decrease
thereby increasing the price, ultimately creating a situation in which
bitcoin is completely hoarded.

Our model however suggests that bitcoin will be able to avoid a
liquidity trap.  The mechanism which we claim this will occur involves
the interaction between bitcoin and fiat currency.  As the price of
bitcoin rises, we claim that people will be more likely to spend their
bitcoin rather than fiat currency, which will cause bitcoin prices to
fall.  Conversely a fall in the price of bitcoin will increase the
likelihood that people will spend bitcoin, and more likely to spend
fiat, and this will cause bitcoin prices to rise.  Krugman's belief
that bitcoin is destined for a liquidity trap ignores the fact that
bitcoin exists within an fiat-based economy, and that the ease of
convertibility to and from fiat prevents a liquidity trap that exists
when convertibility is difficult.

\section{Conclusion}
We caution that the correctness of the model will be determined by
future empirical observations of the bitcoin market.  However, we hope
to illustrate that the behavior of bitcoin can be modelled using basic
economic principles, and we hope that this working paper will
stimulate research and discussion in this area.
