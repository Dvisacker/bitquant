In recent months, bitcoin has received a lot of attention in the
media, and there has been much discussion online concerning the
regulatory aspects of bitcoin.  In this article, we survey the role of
bitcoin within the financial regulatory structure of Hong Kong playing
special attention to Hong Kong's unique position as an international
financial center within the People's Republic of China.  We examine
the relevant laws and regulation in Hong Kong concerning bitcoin and
the implications of bitcoin's designation as a virtual commodity.  We
then example the purpose of financial regulation and argue that the
current regulatory structure is well suited to those goals.  We then
examine the possible future of the regulation of bitcoin and list a
number of areas for attention by regulators and provide
recommendations for bitcoins possible future.
