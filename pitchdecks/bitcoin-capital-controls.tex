  \frametitle{Basic Summary}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Capital controls are necessary in the current financial
      system
    \item Bitcoin is different and should not be subject to capital
      control
    \item Digital currency will be essential to RMB
      internationalization
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Current situation}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item RMB is currently under stress as US raises interest rates
  \item Possible trade friction under Trump Presidency
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Current international trade system}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Changes every twenty years
  \item US dollar as international trading token
    \item National governments must have huge reserves of US dollar in
      order to continue international trade
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Current system causes vulnerablity to crisis}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item What should happen is that as different national economies
      have different monetary policies, that currency exchange rates
      adjust
    \item If your currency becomes weaker, what should happen is your
      exports become cheaper and this stimulates your economy
    \item This does not happen
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{What does happen - CRISIS}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Drop in currency value leads to run on reserves
  \item Run on reserves causes currency value to drop
  \item Can destroy an economy in days (Mexico, Argentina, Asian
    Financial Crisis)
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The basic problem}
  Money is being used for three things:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Store value
  \item Transmit value
  \item Unit of calculation
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The root of currency crisis}
The fact that you need USD to do international trade means that if you
are in a situation where you need USD, the exchange rate suddenly
changes, and it destroys the use of local currency as a store of
value and as a unit of calculation
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Why Bitcoin is different}
  Bitcoin is different because:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Converting RMB->bitcoin->USD uses USD that are not part of
    local currency reserve
  \item Because bitcoin is used *only* as a settlement token, the
    price of bitcoin can move massively without hitting the real
    economy.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Recommendations}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Ring-fence bitcoin transactions from banking system
  \item Watch for impact of bitcoin on foreign exchange reserves
    \item Do not put restrictions on CNY:XBT unless something suggests
      that this framework is wrong
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{RMB will not become a new reserve currency}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item USD became reserve currency only after decades of US trade
      deficits
    \item China is unwilling to run massive trade deficits (and
      neither is anyone else)
    \item US is likely not to want to keep running trade deficits
      (Trump)
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Why do you *need* a reserve currency}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item You can do settlement with any store of value
    \item If you have an asset that is used only for trade settlement,
      this serves as a good link between nations
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Bitcoin will not be that token}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Technical limits in bitcoin network prevent use for trillion
      dollar transaction
    \item Governance limitations - Who decides on technical changes to
      speed up bitcoin
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Asset backed tokens}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Use precious metals (gold and silver)
  \item Have trusted entities issue asset backed tokens
    \item Not a gold standard, since the price of the tokens can
      fluctuate wildly based on demand
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
